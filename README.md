# Checklists
Simple checklist application for QA/testing purposes

(draft, non-production)

## General workflow


## installation

* git clone
* npm install


## TODO
* User management
- [ ] nothing done yet, except for database structure and basic authorization
* Reporting
- [ ] only one dataset per report is available now, while database structure allows to attach several datasets to one report. Reports/index.js getViewSingleDS should be replaced by getView when getView is fixed.
- [ ] genericreport.hbs is not actually generic. It should be redesigned to handle variable data or thrown out.
- [ ] the report template name shall be taken from 'maket' property of the view.

* Checklists
- [ ] Complete editing feature
- [ ] Complete process feature
